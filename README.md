# SimpleFileEncrypt
Just a very simple encryption program for non-critical files.

Note: Do not use this for crital files. This program is only for items you want to hide from non-programmers or other peering eyes with no experience in code.
Make sure you keep back ups of files you encrypt. Included are two ways to encrypt: One will leave the original file and create a new encrypted files. The other method will replace the original file with the encrypted file of the same name.
